# Color Game

A playable link here: https://omorfarukrakib.github.io/Color-Game/

This is a simple web-based game. I have used simple html, css and javascript to create this game where a player will be asked to simply guess a color by it's name. If the player can guess the color right then score will be updated and there is a high score option to track the highest guessing streak.

You can just download the .exe file and run the game.
OR you have to download all the files (html, css, js) and then open the colorGame.html to run the game.
The game will look like this.
